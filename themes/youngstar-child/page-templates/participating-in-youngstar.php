                <p class='main__text'>To continue participating in YoungStar, you must renew your contract every two years. Renewal and Off-Year Services Applications are mailed directly to programs and are also available in the <a class='link main__link' href='https://dcf.wisconsin.gov/childcare/provider-portal/info' target="_blank">Provider Portal</a>. YoungStar Renewal Contracts must be submitted by the first day of a providerâ€™s Anniversary Month to continue participation. Returning an Off-Year Services Application is optional for all programs.</p>
                <p class='main__text'>Before submitting a renewal contract, programs should review all <a class='link main__link' href='https://dcf.wisconsin.gov/youngstar/providers/policy' target="_blank">YoungStart polices</a>.</p>
                <p class='main__text'>If you are an existing YoungStar program and want to open a new location, it is your responsibility to complete and submit a new YoungStar Contract for that location (see above). Every location needs its own YoungStar contract and will receive its own YoungStar rating.</p>

            <h2 class='article__heading'>Is it Optional to Participate?</h2>
            <p class='article__text'>Any regulated provider that wishes to receive Wisconsin Shares authorizations from families MUST participate in YoungStar. Participation in YoungStar is optional for all other regulated providers. While there are choices about which free YoungStar services a program takes, and how a program chooses to complete their required biannual rating, Wisconsin Shares authorizations can be jeopardized by failure to apply or reapply to YoungStar within the provided timelines.</p>
